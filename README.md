# Introduction

The [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) is a popular initiative designed to help participants improve their SQL skills through a series of progressively challenging problems. It is created by [Danny Ma](https://linktr.ee/datawithdanny) and hosted on his website, [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/).\
I will be taking up this challenge and will be improving my SQL skills by working on case studies which mimics the real-world business problems
