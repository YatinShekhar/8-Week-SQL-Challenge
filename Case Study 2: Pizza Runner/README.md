This is the second case study of **8 Week SQL Challenge**.

- This [Case Study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/) is the most challenging I have encountered so far.
- I approached it with all the `SQL` knowledge I have accumulated, and the journey has been incredibly rewarding. 
- The best aspect of this project was the process itself. I gained a deep understanding of new concepts, and by breaking down each problem step by step, I steadily built my confidence.

# Project Overview üìã
- After the successful launch of [Danny's Diner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/), Danny has decided to start his new venture called [Pizza Runner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).
- Danny has build a mobile app for receiving all the orders and alos recruited runners which would be assisting in delivering pizzas.
- With the few days of the operations, Danny has collected the data and now wants to apply calculations to his data to optimiste
the Pizza Runner's operations and to guide his runners well.
- There are few tables in this case study which need to be cleaned before using them in the queries.

# Tables 
- **runners:** It contains `runner_id` along with the `registration_date`.
- **customer_orders:** All the information about the customer's orders is recorded in this table along with the `customer_id`.
- **runner_orders:** It contains information about the delivery of the order along with the `runner_id`.
- **pizza_names:** All the `pizza_name` along with `pizza_id`.
- **pizza_toppings:** All the toppings available along with `topping_id`.
- **pizza_recipes:** The specific toppings used in the making of specific pizzas.

# Note: üí°
I have solved each question using a single SQL statement. But for your understanding, I will breaking some of the complex questions into different steps.

# Data Cleaning ‚õè
Their are two tables `customer_orders` and `runner_orders` which needs cleaning like handling **null**, cleaning particular columns, assigning proper datatypes, etc., before using them into the queries.
## Customer_Orders

This is the metadata of the `customer_orders` dataset.

```sql
describe customer_orders;
```

| Field        | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
|--------------|------------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| order_id     | int        | YES  |     |         |       |
| customer_id  | int        | YES  |     |         |       |
| pizza_id     | int        | YES  |     |         |       |
| exclusions   | varchar(4) | YES  |     |         |       |
| extras       | varchar(4) | YES  |     |         |       |
| order_time   | timestamp  | YES  |     |         |       |

By looking at the metadata, it seems pretty fine. Therefore, we do not require `DDL Commands` to change the structure of the data.

This is how the uncleaned table looks like :-

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time           |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 18:05:02  |
| 2        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 19:00:52  |
| 3        | 102         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-02 23:51:23  |
| 3        | 102         | 2        |            | NaN    | 2021-01-02 23:51:23  |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46  |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46  |
| 4        | 103         | 2        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46  |
| 5        | 104         | 1        | null       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:00:29  |
| 6        | 101         | 2        | null       | null   | 2021-01-08 21:03:13  |
| 7        | 105         | 2        | null       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:20:29  |
| 8        | 102         | 1        | null       | null   | 2021-01-09 23:54:33  |
| 9        | 103         | 1        | 4          | 1, 5   | 2021-01-10 11:22:59  |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | null       | null   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49  |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | 2, 6       | 1, 4   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49  |

- The 'null' string in the `exclusions` column needs to be assigned **null**.
- The `extras` contains unknown values as **'NaN'** and **'null'** string which needs to be converted into one particular type that is **null**.
- We will be using `DML Command` like `update` to clean the dataset.

```sql
update customer_orders
set 
  exclusions = case when exclusion in ('', 'null') then null end,
  extras = case when extras in ('', 'null') then null end
  where exclusions in ('', 'null') or extras in ('', 'null');
```
And this is how the table looks like after claning the table :-

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time           |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-01 18:05:02  |
| 2        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-01 19:00:52  |
| 3        | 102         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-02 23:51:23  |
| 3        | 102         | 2        |            |        | 2020-01-02 23:51:23  |

| 5        | 104         | 1        |            | 1      | 2020-01-08 21:00:29  |
| 6        | 101         | 2        |            |        | 2020-01-08 21:03:13  |

## Runner_Orders

This is the metadata of the raw dataset :-

```sql
describe runner_orders;
```

| Field        | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
|--------------|-------------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| order_id     | int         | YES  |     |         |       |
| runner_id    | int         | YES  |     |         |       |
| pickup_time  | varchar(19) | YES  |     |         |       |
| distance     | varchar(7)  | YES  |     |         |       |
| duration     | varchar(10) | YES  |     |         |       |
| cancellation | varchar(23) | YES  |     |         |       |

The `pickup_time` needs to be converted into datetime, `distance` and `duration` into numeric datatype.\
We will be using `DDL Command` to change the definition of the table. But we will be doing it after cleaning the table.\
This is how the raw table looks like :-

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time          | distance | duration     | cancellation             |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 1         | 2021-01-01 18:15:34  | 20km     | 32 minutes   |                          |
| 2        | 1         | 2021-01-01 19:10:54  | 20km     | 27 minutes   |                          |
| 3        | 1         | 2021-01-03 00:12:37  | 13.4km   | 20 mins      | NaN                      |
| 4        | 2         | 2021-01-04 13:53:03  | 23.4     | 40           | NaN                      |
| 5        | 3         | 2021-01-08 21:10:57  | 10       | 15           | NaN                      |
| 6        | 3         | null                 | null     | null         | Restaurant Cancellation  |
| 7        | 2         | 2020-01-08 21:30:45  | 25km     | 25mins       | null                     |
| 8        | 2         | 2020-01-10 00:15:02  | 23.4 km  | 15 minute    | null                     |
| 9        | 2         | null                 | null     | null         | Customer Cancellation    |
| 10       | 1         | 2020-01-11 18:50:20  | 10km     | 10minutes    | null                     |

- The `distance` column needs to be cleaned and converted into numeric datatype.
- Same goes with `duration` column.
- And dealing with **'null'** and **'NaN'** values in the `cancellation` column.

```sql
update runner_orders
set
  pickup_time = case when pickup_time in ('', 'null') then null 
                     else pickup_time end,
  distance = case when distance = 'null' then null
		              when distance like '%km' then replace(distance, 'km', '') 
		              else distance end,
  duration = case when duration = 'null' then null
		              when duration like '%m%' then trim(insert(duration, position('m' in duration), length(duration), '')) 
		              else duration end, 
  cancellation = case when cancellation in ('', 'null') then null 
                      else cancellation end
  where 
  pickup_time in ('', 'null') or
  distance = 'null' or 
  distance like '%km%' or
  duration = 'null' or
  duration like '%m%' or
  cancellation in ('null', '');
```

- After cleaning the table, we also need to convert the datatypes of the cleaned column into the required ones.
- We will be changing the datatypes of the columns using `alter` `modify` command.

```sql
alter table runner_orders
modify pickup_time timestamp,
modify distance float,
modify duration int;
```

This is how the cleaned version looks like :-

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time          | distance | duration | cancellation             |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 1         | 2020-01-01 18:15:34  | 20       | 32       |                          |
| 2        | 1         | 2020-01-01 19:10:54  | 20       | 27       |                          |
| 3        | 1         | 2020-01-03 00:12:37  | 13.4     | 20       |                          |
| 4        | 2         | 2020-01-04 13:53:03  | 23.4     | 40       |                          |
| 5        | 3         | 2020-01-08 21:10:57  | 10       | 15       |                          |
| 6        | 3         |                      |          |          | Restaurant Cancellation  |
| 7        | 2         | 2020-01-08 21:30:45  | 25       | 25       |                          |
| 8        | 2         | 2020-01-10 00:15:02  | 23.4     | 15       |                          |
| 9        | 2         |                      |          |          | Customer Cancellation    |
| 10       | 1         | 2020-01-11 18:50:20  | 10       | 10       |                          |

Since the tables have been cleaned, therefore let's move to the case studies.

# Case Studies ‚ùì

This project consists of 5 different case studies. Therefore we will be solving them one by one.

# 1. Pizza Metrices

## 1.1 How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
select count(*) as pizza_ordered
from customer_orders;
```
| pizzas_ordered |
|----------------|
| 14             |

- There were a total of 14 pizzas ordered from `Pizza Runner`

## **1.2 How many unique customer orders were made?**

```sql
select count(distinct order_id) as unique_customer_orders
from customer_orders;
```
| unique_customer_orders |
|------------------------|
| 10                     |

- Total 10 orders were unique customer orders

## **1.3 How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

- Successful orders are the orders which were delivered and not cancelled by the customer or the restaurant.

```sql
select runner_id, count(order_id) as successful_deliveries
from runner_orders
where cancellation is null
group by runner_id;
```

| runner_id | successful_deliveries |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1         | 4                      |
| 2         | 3                      |
| 3         | 1                      |

- **Runner 1** delivered 4 orders
- **Runner 2** delivered 3 orders
- **Runner 3** delivered 1 successful order

## **1.4 How many each type of pizza was delivered?**

```sql
select pizza_id, pizza_name, count(*) as pizza_delivered
from customer_orders
inner join pizza_names using(pizza_id)
inner join runner_orders using(order_id)
where cancellation is null
group by pizza_id, pizza_name;
```

| pizza_id | pizza_name  | pizzas_delivered |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1        | Meatlovers  | 9               |
| 2        | Vegetarian  | 3               |

- There were total 14 pizzas ordered. Out of them 12 were delivered and 2 were cancelled.
- Out of 12 delivered pizzas, 9 were `Meatlovers` and 3 were `Vegetarian`

## **1.5 How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

```sql
select customer_id,
sum(case when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' then 1 else 0 end) as Meatlovers , 
sum(case when pizza_name = 'Vegetarian' then 1 else 0 end) as Vegetarian 
from customer_orders
inner join pizza_names using(pizza_id)
group by customer_id;
```

| customer_id | Meatlovers | Vegetarian |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 101         | 2          | 1          |
| 102         | 2          | 1          |
| 103         | 3          | 1          |
| 104         | 3          | 0          |
| 105         | 0          | 1          |

- By looking at the result, it seems customers loves `Meatlovers` as compared to `Vegetarian`

## **1.6 What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**

```sql
select co.order_id, co.customer_id, count(*) as no_of_orders_delivered
from customer_orders co 
inner join runner_orders ro using(order_id)
where cancellation is null
group by order_id, customer_id
order by no_of_orders_delivered desc
limit 1;
```

| order_id | customer_id | no_of_orders_delivered |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| 4        | 103         | 3                      |

- `Customer 103` ordered maximum number of pizzas in an order

## **1.7 For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**

```sql
select customer_id,
sum(case when exclusions is null and extras is null then 1 else 0 end) as had_no_change,
sum(case when exclusions is not null or extras is not null then 1 else 0 end) as had_at_least_one_change
from customer_orders 
inner join runner_orders using(order_id)
where cancellation is null
group by customer_id;
```

| customer_id | had_no_change | had_at_least_one_change |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 101         | 2             | 0                       |
| 102         | 3             | 0                       |
| 103         | 0             | 3                       |
| 104         | 1             | 2                       |
| 105         | 0             | 1                       |

## **1.8 How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**

```sql
select sum(case when exclusions is not null and extras is not null then 1 else 0 end) as no_of_pizzas_with_exclusion_and_extras
from customer_orders 
inner join runner_orders using(order_id)
where cancellation is null;
```

| no_of_pizzas_with_exclusion_and_extras |
|----------------------------------------|
| 1                                      |

## **1.9 What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?**

```sql
with recursive cte as (
select 0 as hour
union all
select hour + 1 from cte where hour < 23)
select hour as hour_of_the_day,
sum(case when order_time is not null then 1 else 0 end) as total_orders
from cte
left join customer_orders
on cte.hour = hour(order_time)
group by hour;
```

I will break this problem into two different stpes.

- Step 1- Creating each hour of the day using `recursive cte`

```sql
with recursive cte as (
select 0 as hour
union all
select hour + 1 from cte where hour < 23)
select * from cte
```

| cte |
|-----|
| 0  |
| 1  |
| 2  |
| 3  |
| 4  |
| 5  |
| 6  |
| 7  |
| 8  |
| 9  |
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 13 |
| 14 |
| 15 |
| 16 |
| 17 |
| 18 |
| 19 |
| 20 |
| 21 |
| 22 |
| 23 |

- Step 2- Querying orders for each hour and joining it to above table.

```sql
select hour as hour_of_the_day,
sum(case when order_time is not null then 1 else 0 end) as total_orders
from cte
left join customer_orders
on cte.hour = hour(order_time)
group by hour;
```

| hour_of_the_day | total_orders |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 0               | 0            |
| 1               | 0            |
| 2               | 0            |
| 3               | 0            |
| 4               | 0            |
| 5               | 0            |
| 6               | 0            |
| 7               | 0            |
| 8               | 0            |
| 9               | 0            |
| 10              | 0            |
| 11              | 1            |
| 12              | 0            |
| 13              | 3            |
| 14              | 0            |
| 15              | 0            |
| 16              | 0            |
| 17              | 0            |
| 18              | 3            |
| 19              | 1            |
| 20              | 0            |
| 21              | 3            |
| 22              | 0            |
| 23              | 3            |

- Firstly created 24 hours of the day, using `recursive cte`
- Then queried for all the orders in each hour
- And finally joined them

## **10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**

```sql
with recursive cte as (
select now() as a, now() as b
union all
select a, date_add(b, interval 1 day) from cte where 
datediff(b,a) <6 )
select dayname(b) as day, count(order_id) as total_orders from cte 
left join customer_orders co
on dayname(b) = dayname(order_time)
group by 1;
```

This problem will also be broken down into two different stpes

- Step 1 - Creating each day of the week using `recursive cte`

```sql
with recursive cte as (
select curdate() as a, curdate() as b
union all
select a, date_add(b, interval 1 day) from cte where 
datediff(b,a) <6 )
, cte2 as (
select dayname(b) as day from cte)
select * from cte2;
```

| day       |
|-----------|
| Tuesday   |
| Wednesday |
| Thursday  |
| Friday    |
| Saturday  |
| Sunday    |
| Monday    |

- Step 2 - Querying orders for each day and joining it to the above table

```sql
select day, count(order_id) as total_orders from cte2
left join customer_orders co
on day = dayname(order_time)
group by day;
```

| day       | total_orders |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tuesday   | 0            |
| Wednesday | 5            |
| Thursday  | 3            |
| Friday    | 1            |
| Saturday  | 5            |
| Sunday    | 0            |
| Monday    | 0            |

- Firstly created 7 days of the week, using `recursive cte`
- Then queried for all the orders in each day
- And finally joined them
