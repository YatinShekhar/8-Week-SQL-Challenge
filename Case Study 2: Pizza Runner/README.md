This is the second case study of **8 Week SQL Challenge**.\
This case study is the most challenging I have encountered so far. I approached it with all the SQL knowledge I have\
accumulated, and the journey has been incredibly rewarding.\ 
The best aspect of this project was the process itself. I gained a deep understanding of new concepts, and by breaking\
down each problem step by step, I steadily built my confidence. This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but\
also improved my problem-solving abilities, making me more proficient and self-assured in SQL.
