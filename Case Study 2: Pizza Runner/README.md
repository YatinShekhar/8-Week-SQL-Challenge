This is the second case study of **8 Week SQL Challenge**.

- This [Case Study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/) is the most challenging I have encountered so far.
- I approached it with all the `SQL` knowledge I have accumulated, and the journey has been incredibly rewarding. 
- The best aspect of this project was the process itself. I gained a deep understanding of new concepts, and by breaking down each problem step by step, I steadily built my confidence.
