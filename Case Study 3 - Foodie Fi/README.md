This is the third case study of **8 Week SQL Challenge**.

- I enjoyed solving this [Case Study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/)
- The project was somewhat easy as compared to previous one but it was tricky at some points.
- SQL concepts like `joins`, `common table expressions`, `windowing functions` were used in the case study.
